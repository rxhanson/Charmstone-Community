Scripts, Localization, and Discussion for the Charmstone App

[Charmstone](https://charmstone.app) is a closed source macOS app for quickly launching and switching applications. It's a convenient way to execute scripts (in the form of applications), and this repository is primarily meant to be a place where users can share their scripts.

To convert a script into an app that can be loaded into Charmstone, Open the script in Script Editor and export it as an Application.

I will soon be localizing the app and have plans to give away keys for the full version to users that contribute localizations.
